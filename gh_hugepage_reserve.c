 * gh_hugepage_reserve
 *
 * Pre-allocates 2MB compound pages at boot and serves them to Gunyah VM
 * memory allocations via kretprobe on __alloc_pages, ensuring VMs get
 * contiguous THP-backed memory even when the system is fragmented.
 *
 * Architecture:
 *
 *   1. Pool allocation (insmod):
 *      Pre-allocate order-9 (2MB) compound pages into a static pool.
 *
 *   2. Always-on kretprobe (__alloc_pages):
 *      Registered at init, intercepts order-9 allocations from tracked
 *      VM owner processes. Replaces the return value with a pool page
 *      and frees the original buddy page (if any) back to avoid double
 *      memory consumption. entry_handler filters by order, pool count,
 *      and mm - overhead is negligible for non-matching calls.
 *
 *   3. VM lifecycle tracking (kprobes):
 *      - Creation:    kprobe on gunyah_dev_vm_mgr_ioctl (GH_CREATE_VM)
 *                     records the caller's mm_struct for filtering.
 *                     Each owner carries a vm_count (VMs created by that mm).
 *      - Destruction: kprobe on gunyah_vm_release / gh_vm_free
 *                     schedules delayed pool refill after VM exits, then
 *                     sweeps owners per-entry: only those whose process is
 *                     dead (mm_users == 0) or whose last VM was closed are
 *                     released. Sibling VMs keep their tracking - one VM
 *                     dying (e.g. OOM kill of one crosvm) must never drop
 *                     the others.
 *
 *   4. Pool refill (delayed work):
 *      After VM shutdown + configurable delay, refills pool from buddy
 *      allocator with compaction/reclaim. Retries on fragmentation.
 *
 * Prerequisites:
 *   echo advise > /sys/kernel/mm/transparent_hugepage/shmem_enabled
 *
 * Usage:
 *   insmod gh_hugepage_reserve.ko pool_want=1024 refill_delay_ms=5000

 * Unified kernel-API object - the module's OWN stable ABI over the kernel.

 * operations that mean the same thing on every supported kernel: call sites
 * just do kapi.op(...) and never see the raw kernel function. Every field is
 * named k_<kernel symbol> - the suffix keeps the backing API recognizable at
 * a glance, and the k_ does two jobs: it marks that the field's prototype and
 * semantics are the module-NORMALIZED contract (the per-field comments below),
 * not necessarily the running kernel's, and it keeps the identifier from ever
 * colliding with a kernel function-like macro (on 6.10+ alloc_contig_{range,
 * pages} are alloc_hooks() macros that would hijack a bare-named field call).
 * Where the kernel contract diverges across versions a shim settles it, e.g.
 * kapi.k_folio_isolate_lru returns bool true=isolated on EVERY kernel even
 * though the 6.1 symbol returns int 0=isolated, and kapi.k_alloc_contig_range
 * takes no migratetype/acr_flags argument at all.
 *
 * Resolution happens once at init (kapi_init, via kprobe). Symbols whose
 * contract is version-stable are stored directly. The four whose contract
 * diverges across GKI bases resolve into the private `kraw` struct instead
 * (prototypes version-gated to match the running kernel - kCFI checks the
 * indirect-call type id) and the kapi field gets a shim that settles the
 * divergence in ONE place:
 *   folio_isolate_lru: 6.1/6.2 return int (0 = isolated); 6.3+
 *     (be2d5756382a) return bool (true = isolated) - a bare truth test would
 *     invert on 6.1, leaking isolated folios off-LRU with the isolation ref
 *     held and list_add-ing folios that are still on the LRU
 *   reclaim_pages: 6.6..6.12 take (list, ignore_refs); others (list)
 *   try_to_free_mem_cgroup_pages: 5.10/5.15 (memcg,nr,gfp,bool may_swap);
 *     6.1/6.6 (…,uint reclaim_options); 6.12+ (…,+int *swappiness)
 *   alloc_contig_range: same C signature everywhere (no CFI difference), but
 *     arg 3 changed meaning: migratetype (<=6.12: pass MIGRATE_MOVABLE) became
 *     acr_flags_t (upstream ~6.16, next GKI base 6.18: pass ACR_FLAGS_NONE=0;
 *     MIGRATE_MOVABLE=1 would alias ACR_FLAGS_CMA and silently run the sweep
 *     in CMA isolation mode), so the shim owns arg 3 and callers never pass it
 *
 * A missing or guard-disabled symbol leaves BOTH the kraw and kapi pointers
 * NULL; callers then either refuse a whole feature (required op - see the
 * kapi_can_* checklists) or degrade (optional enhancer - guarded at the call

 * (b) migrate_cma_val is really MIGRATE_CMA (accounting moves with it),
 * (c) CONTIG_RANGE_CMA can grab a block back. Runs UNCONDITIONALLY at every
 * init (cma_boot_build) and nowhere else - its outcome folds into cma_capable
 * as a boot constant, so there is no first-run runtime state to manage.
 *
 * The span is TWO pageblocks at DOUBLE alignment, fully held. That shape is
 * what makes an off-by-one-level pageblock_order_val belief SAFE to probe: if
 * the belief is one too small, the flip covers the whole held span and the
 * base+PB_NR readback (expected MOVABLE, reads CMA) catches it; if one too
 * big, the flip covers only the first real block and the base+PB_NR-1
 * readback (expected CMA, reads MOVABLE) catches it. Either way nothing
 * outside memory we hold was ever relabeled, and the flip-back restores it
 * whole. One allocation of order pb+1 provides the span where the kernel
 * allows it; otherwise (order-10 pageblocks on 6.1, whose max alloc order is
 * 10) one pageblock is allocated and its 2x-alignment sibling is grabbed with
 * a movable-mode contig range.
 *
 * Candidates may carry ANY whitelisted label ({0,1,2}, like every other
 * flip): the boundary checks compare against RECORDED pre-values, not against
 * a hardcoded MOVABLE, so steal residue does not defeat them. This matters in
 * the field: after the module itself has churned GFP_KERNEL blocks through
 * buddy for a while, movable high-order allocations come back with UNMOVABLE
 * residue labels almost every time (measured: a runtime enable on the OnePlus
 * exhausted eight strictly-MOVABLE candidates and silently fell back to v9).
 * A candidate with a non-whitelisted label is HELD until the hunt ends:
 * freeing it at once would just hand the same block back on the next try.
 *
 * On success the span becomes reservoir blocks #1 and #2 (zero waste). On a
 * pre-write mismatch: nothing was written, swap candidates (bounded, then
 * pr_warn + feature stays unverified). On any post-write failure: systemic -
 * restore the recorded label if still clean, otherwise ABANDON the first
 * block CMA-labeled (its label and freelist stay mutually consistent; the
 * memory remains app-usable movable; it merely refuses unmovable allocations
 * until reboot), pr_err, feature off.

 *
 * The per-block allocation is deliberately UNMOVABLE (GFP_KERNEL), not

 * reservoir dominates the zone's free memory the allocator starts handing the
 * builder its own CMA blocks back (label 3 -> whitelist reject), starving the

 * served from a CMA freelist, at the cost of an UNMOVABLE steal-residue label
 * on the block - which is exactly what the {0,1,2} whitelist exists to accept
 * (the flip is safe regardless of label because every page is held).
 *
 * Rejected candidates (foreign-CMA/highatomic/CHP labels) are held to the end
 * - freeing one immediately would hand the same block right back. Every early
